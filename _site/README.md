Why does this repo exist?

Well, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) has added a way to modify your site's theme and appearance - by installing theme gems. This is great if you want to use a published theme or style your site without diving into code, but is annoying if you want to get your hands dirty and style your own site. For those front-end programmers who like diving into code, here is the starting template of a Jekyll site that allows you to style your own pages before gem theming arrived on the scene.

Simply copy any part of the folder structure into your current project and Jekyll will automatically look in the corresponding directories to build your site.  Happy programming!
